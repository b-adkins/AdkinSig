# Introduction
The universe is a computer that computes reality. It solves incredibly complex computational problems as it advances time - such as quantum wave functions, protein folding, and n-body simulations for trillion trillions of particles. With the right technology and enough connections to the universe - also known as sensors - we can make lies fundamentally too expensive to tell.

For most of human history, consistency has been a bedrock principle of truth. We talk about shining light in dark places, of drowning fiction in fact. Journalists treat The Story as if it were a Platonic form waiting to be discovered, not a narrative to be written.[citation] Cross-examination, interrogation; these practices rely on self-consistency to uncover truth.

Fakery has gotten easier with technology. Airbrushing has been around for many decades, but required special equipment and skills [citation]. Photo-editing software, such as Photoshop or its free cousin GIMP, produced an explosion of fake pictures.[citation needed] The software may have been relatively cheap, but the skill to use it was not. That has changed.

We are in an era of #DeepFakes, where through deep learning, computers have gotten incredibly skillful at faking images, audio, and video. [list of citations] These tools are free and open-source. Though the results are not perfect now, they will only improve. As deep fakes get more convincing and easier to use, there will be an explosion of fake media. 

We are rapidly approaching the point where human senses cannot tell fiction from reality and where these fictions are nearly free to produce. Reality itself is at stake, threatening to fragment into echo chambers of comfortable fiction. A world with ubiquitous fake media is a frightening one, where trolls, special interests, and nation states can leverage AI to tell ever more convincing lies. For instance, to sway voters and customers. Democracy, the free market, and other reality-based institutions fundamental to the modern world are at stake.

# The AdkinSig
To solve this problem, I introduce the AdkinSig. I define the AdkinSig as "a cryptographic instrument that leverages live broadcasts and complex dynamical systems to dramatically increase the difficulty of constructing consistent fiction." Now that human intelligence is not sufficient to sift through fiction, for truth to triumph, we must use technology to make it cost-prohibitive to tell fictions as convincing as objective reality.

The AdkinSig is based on the following premises:

1. Truth of objective reality keeps itself consistent. Causality is fundamental in physics. Cause follows effect throughout the universe at all macroscopic scales.
2. Fiction requires work to keep consistent. To convince a skeptical intelligence, a series of Lies must be consistent with themselves and existing Beliefs
3. For certain subsets of Reality, maintaining a consistent fiction of N facts is NP complete

(For probing Subjective reality with this principle, see my concept of Consciousness Tritation.)

A liar must write an alternate story with little help from the Universe. Liars look for gaps or weak areas of Understanding that they can replace with a more compelling narrative. The stronger the Understanding, the more detail the liar must provide to be convincing. To provide this detail, a liar must simulate the World to create an alternative Fiction.[cite: MRI evidence] The more skeptical the audience, the more computationally expensive this simulation must become.

This is where we use the universe as a computer.  I propose we develop industry standards, piggy-backing on cryptographic technologies - such as public-private key encryption, digital signatures, blockchain - to create indelible, expensive-to-fake records of sensor data, Beliefs, and Understandings. The goal is that, whatever the fiction-producing technology of the day, AdkinSig equipped devices will stay a step ahead, making fiction prohibitively expensive to maintain. As quantum computing, DNA computing, and artificial intelligence advance, the next generation of AdkinSig will be there to combat the fakes. The basic human desire for Truth should pressure the market and nation-states into adopting AdkinSigs in all digital sensors in the Internet of Things.

# Comparison to Existing Approaches
Existing cryptographic solutions to this problem are centralized. They require a cyrptographically-maintained chain of trust to a central authority to Vouch for data integrity, time, and place. 

By contrast, AdkinSig implementations can improve credibility of information even when run on untrustworthy hardware, though they will (I hypothesize) become virtually unfakeable with cooperative hardware. Through the consistency of the universe, with enough measurements, the truth must come out.

# Mathematical Proof of Computational Difficulty
I define the following statements:

Truth = an objectively true statement
Belief = a perception of reality. True beliefs = truth; false beliefs = a lie
Fact = a Belief considered Truth in a sufficiently large inter-subjective World
Lie = an objectively false statement

And collections of statements:

- Reality = a graph of true statements, directed by causality
- Understanding = a graph of statements, perceived to be true
- Fiction = a graph of false statements, directed by causality

And objects:

- Perceptor = a creature or object that maintains Beliefs and Understanding of its World
- Agent = a Perceptor able to act and influence its part of the World
- World = any self-consistent system in which a Perceptor can perceive. Can be physical reality, inter-subjective reality, or virtual reality

[proof will be attempted!]

# Indexing
To cost-effectively aggregate AdkinSig sousveillance data, I propose all AdkinSig entries be indexed by hash table. Unique buckets in the hash space can be claimed with the following tuple:

    AdkinsSig.index = <implementation name, version number, spacetime coordinates>
    spacetime coordinates = <t, x1, x2, ... >

The implementation name and version number will uniquely map to an AdkinSig specification. This then allows lookup of bin size, datastructures within bins, and the meaning of the space-time coordinates. The most efficient implementation naturally depends on the application, but this becomes a software engineering problem.

The uniqueness of implementation names can be protected by intellectual property law, version control, digital signature authorities, and crytographic instruments such as blockchain and the Interplanetary File System. This hash index can then be published freely as a filename suffix, metadata, or other methods for attaching it to a piece of data.

# Validation
The index only describes how to uniquely identify any Belief and search them efficiently. It does not confirm that the Belief is a Fact; nor does it confirm that the Belief was created at a time and place. The following sections will address each of these problems.

# Anchor in Place
## Localization
GPS, GLONASS, etc provide incredibly precise localizations in spacetime. Localization will only continue to improve, with [local trasmitters] and SLAM-equipped robots.

The trick is proving that a location measurement is true. With cooperation by manufacturers, this could be assured by BeliefToFact validation, below. Without cooperation of manufacturers, it should still be possible to prove veracity of sensor readings - localization and the phenomenon measured - by leveraging physics.

## Vouched by physics
Between all transmitters and receivers of information exist physical phenomena. Signal attenuation and distortion can be described with a transfer function between transmitter and receiver. Transfer functions get prohibitively expensive to compute as Modes increase. Thus for complex devices such as smartphones, manufactures rely heavily on emperical measurements. With signal processing and machine learning, I hypothesize that transfer functions can approximated cheaply from measurement.

A sensor's trajectory through spacetime maps to a set of transfer functions for each signal received. Signal background can be segmented at natural boundaries in frequency and time - for instance <the ISM band; packet ID>. I hypothesize that a sufficient number of signals can form a unique signature for any device at any point in spacetime. A number of AdkinSig devices can sample a transfer function across successive points in space. Together, physics should ensure that these samples are consistent. Usage statistics for AdkinSig sample sets can set the standard for veracity of media by on-location citizens and journalists.

Perhaps with careful preparation - detailed enough measurements of a place, for instance wall geometry and material, location of smart phones, location of cell towers, broadcast schedule - any such signature could be faked. But the cost will be high. Faking such a location signature requires the high fixed cost of creating ever more elaborate simulations. And each fake AdkinSig has a marginal cost in computation and time delay to connect a Fiction consistently to the rest of Beliefs. It is the goal of this technology to make this cost prohibitive, that any benefit to faking media will be outweighed by its immense cost.

# Anchor in Time
## Anchor Before - Blockchain
Blockchain can anchor data in time, as part of the a block in a self-consistent cryptographic chain. Each block in the chain has a time associated with it.[citation] This only date of publication. How do we prove that a piece of information came into existence shortly before publication?

## Anchor After - Verification "by Newspaper"
Newspapers have been used as proof-of-life for decades - by kidnappers, but also by leaders of poor health [cite Castro], and zoos [cite that panda] - and entered the public consciousness through entertainment. The principle is that a picture cannot be older than the date of a reputable publication attached to it, for that publication - e.g. the [date] issue of the New York Times - was not made public before then, and most definitely didn't exist the day prior, for fast-moving media outlets. To fake such a photo requires tight media control - which can credibly be disproved by the limited resources of an organization (for instance a zoo) or by using a foreign paper (for instance the Castro regime?).

The AdkinSig incorporates a 21st-century update to this approach. The timeline of existence and public availability of any piece of media can be attached to another piece of information to confirm it was created after its time. With the ubiquity of smartphones, it should thus be possible to aggregate live radio, television, webcams, gaming streams, etc. into a signature of time of creation, without any new hardware.

Combined with the BlockChain, these techniques anchor a piece of information to a window in time. The tighter the window, the shorter the delay between recording the data and publishing it to the BlockChain, the greater the credibility. Fakes created from live information will always lag behind truth because it requires extra computation to incorporate live data into a consistent fiction. 

With computational asymmetry - for instance, state supercomputers versus citizen smartphones - fakes can be produced more quickly. Possibly more quickly than citizens can upload to the Internet! It my hope that with the right approach, the problem can be made large enough to render this impossible.

# Use Cases: Dictator, Yes You Did!
In the 20th century and before, state censorship meant suppressing information. In the 21st century, where the "Net treats censorship as damage and routes around it" [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore. http://kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html], increasingly, propogandists instead attack the credibility of dissenting information and flood the population with fiction. The goal of the AdkinSig is to make this practice prohibitively expensive. The following use cases examine how AdkinSig-empowered sousveillance[cite: Steve Mann] can hold bad actors accountable.

## Full Internet Access
This is the easiest case. Already, sousveillance evidence captured gathered via ubiquitous cameraphones and posted to social media has been used as to prosecute a war crime [cite: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/world/middleeast/syria-war-crime.html]. Photographs were cross-checked by an open-source investigation with other evidence - including satellite photographs and weather records to reconstruct a self-consistent narrative. The U.N. is struggling with the Big Data volume of evidence from modern conflicts [cite]; however it is a matter of time before artificial intelligence technology can keep up.

In the era of #DeepFakes, an AdkinSig app will add extra credibility to media evidence by publishing cryptographic proof of authenticity immediately to decentralized public ledgers, such as blockchains.

## Partial RF Jamming
If internet access is limited, AdkinSig veracity can still be proven if:

1. An AdkinSig can be transmitted out. Its file size would be on the order of existing digital signatures, much smaller than typical MB+ media files. Narrow-beam transmission, jamming-penetrating network protocols, mesh networking, and other Signal Warfare advances make it plausible that limited bandwidth would be available to activists in a significant number of jamming scenarios
2. The media file itself can make it onto the Internet at a later date, for instance if hidden until jamming ceases or the data is moved out of jamming range

The media file will be anchored in an AdkinSig Window in time and space that retroactively proves its authenticity when it eventually is published.

## Complete RF Jamming
1. The AdkinSig cannot incorporate any broadcasts - local or from the Internet. There is still one RF source guaranteed to be available - the jamming signal itself! A frequency hopping fight, where jammed transmitters attempt to discover free frequencies and jamming transmitters attempt to flood them with noise - by a device with a deterministic frequency-hopping policy leaves a record that can serve as an AdkinSig.
2. The AdkinSig and the media file are smuggled out of jamming range physically - for instance, an SD card in a shoe or a courier microdrone

The AdkinSig window in time will be longer - the length of time between media creation and smuggling to the blockchain. However, the act of jamming itself can produce an AdkinSig, that can be validated by all jammed devices present and others further away that capture the, by definition, intense jamming signal. For as long as the jamming is performed, it provides an ongoing signature of events to bridge the gap in spacetime between information creation and publication to the blockchain.

# Industry "Belief to Fact" Standards
This is where industry partnerships come it. Devices following AdkinSig requirements can be assumed to have experienced physical phenomen corresponding to their reported sensor data.

For an AdkinSig Belief to be confirmed as Fact, the following hardware is required:

- Sensor ICs with a unique private key that provide a) spacetime coordinates and b) physical measurements
- Networking IC with a unique private key
- Homomorphic encryption connecting them, ensuring even untrustworthy software can't fake a single packet

How to generate trustworthy private keys in IoT hardware is a problem for other research. Manufacturers will have to prove the uniqueness and irreproducibility of the private keys shipped in their products. Unique variations in ICs become a crucial security feature. With public-private key pairs, the ICs will be able to verify data sent between them. And manufacturers will be able to connect data to the IC serial number.

I hypothesize that veracity of physical phenomenon could be almost guaranteed if the sensor IC and networking IC could both be extracted safely. As technology continues to miniaturize, physical extraction of data will only get more and more difficult to prevent. With the manufacturer's assistance, any AdkinSig IC can provide compelling evidence. To fake an image in an AdkinSig-protected camera - composed of GPS, CCD, and 4G connection - a bad actor would have to fake the photons entering the camera lens. No small feat for cheap and ubiquitous cameras!

# Challenges
## AdkinSig from Physics
The time verification AdkinSig can be implemented immediately. The location-vouching AdkinSig is a bigger challenge.

While the universe may be deterministic at macroscopic scales, in practice, models of sensors and dynamical systems are stochastic. Cryptographic vouching, on the other hand, requires determinism. Generating signatures deterministically from highly complex stochastic processes is a challenge for an entire field of research.

In the meantime, even without a positional AdkinSig, positional veracity can still come from consistency. After all, the war crimes case against [Syrian bad guy] derived the veracity of media evidence not from cryptography, but from consistency and credibility of sources. Sousveillance pictures alone would not have proved the case; satellite photos, weather records, and other measurements outside the control of the Syrian regime lended credibility to picutres of the war crime.

## Credibility of the AdkinSig itself
Most people do not understand they technology they depend on. Credit cards, computers, and cars might as well be magic to the majority of people. Political leaders have historically struggled with email; now they struggle with AI and blockchain. Business leaders rely on engineers and Millennials to advise them about new technology. Science and engineering literacy is low.[citation] The lay person can be told to trust a technology, but they must take the word of institutions and people with the capacity to actually understand that technology.

I have faith that if we build it, trust will come. Lay people may not understand the details of public-private key encryption, but they can trust Microsoft or their bank to tell that data has been encrypted or an identity verified. Lay people do not understand blockchain, but they understand that investors, coworkers, and relatives do and consider it has merit - expensively Signalled by putting real money into it. 

Building public trust in AdkinSig may be a protracted campaign, waged in 21st-century propaganda arenas such as social media. However, I think that with enough education, eventually everybody will know and trust somebody who does understand and can verify an AdkinSig. As human-computer intelligence collectively increase together, but the complexity of the fundamental idea (as opposed to any specific implementation) stays constant, I think the AdkinSig will eventually come within the understanding of every school-child and every citizen. 

# Conclusion
I propose the AdkinSig, a type of physical-computational-cryptographic system that uses difficult-to-compute physical phenomena to anchor sensor data to time, space, and sensor hardware, and the blockchain to indelibly preserve a record. It is my hope that so long as the Universe remains the best computer of Reality, truth will have a chance.
